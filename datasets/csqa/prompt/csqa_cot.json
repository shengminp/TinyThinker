      "A is incorrect. Because 'harder' refers to the level of effort, not an emotional state, and doesn't match the emotional context of imbalance leading to divorce.",
      "B is incorrect. Because 'anguish' indicates severe distress, it may not fully capture the specific feelings of imbalance and discontent in this scenario.",
      "C is correct. Because 'bitterness' accurately reflects feelings of anger and disappointment from unmet expectations and perceived imbalance, aligning with the scenario.",
      "D is incorrect. Because 'tears' indicate a physical manifestation of emotions but do not specify the emotional state related to the feeling of being overburdened.",

    "Explanations": [
      "A is incorrect. Because Niagara Falls is primarily associated with its waterfalls, not a setting of soft moss and tree views.",
      "B is correct. Because a forest offers both soft moss to lie on and numerous trees to look up at, matching the scenario's description.",
      "C is incorrect. Because while waterfalls can be found in forests, the specific mention of laying on soft moss and looking up at trees directly suggests a broader environment than just the area near a waterfall.",
      "D is incorrect. Because while the man is technically on the ground, it is too general and misses the specific natural characteristics implied by the details of soft moss and trees.",
