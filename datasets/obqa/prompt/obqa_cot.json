    "Q": "What is the most likely to be an effect of acid rain on an aquatic environment?",
    "Options": "A. decrease in plant life, B. increase in fish population, C. increase in plant growth, D. cleaner and clearer water",
    "Key Information": "Acid rain, containing harmful acidic compounds, detrimentally affects aquatic environments by altering water chemistry, harmful to aquatic life.",
    "Explanations": [
      "A is correct. Because acid rain reduces water pH, harming aquatic plants, consistent with the concept that acid rain negatively affects aquatic life.",
      "B is incorrect. Because acid rain decreases fish populations by introducing harmful chemicals, contrary to the idea of an increase.",
      "C is incorrect. Because acid rain impedes plant growth due to its acidity, opposing the concept of promoting a healthy aquatic environment.",
      "D is incorrect. Because acid rain pollutes water, reducing clarity, aligning with the concept of its harmful impacts on aquatic environments."

    "Q": "The moon's surface",
    "Options": "A. is smooth on the entire surface, B. contains large cavities cause by explosions, C. contains an internal core of cheese, D. is filled with lakes",
    "Key Information": "The moon's surface is characterized by a variety of geological features, including craters from asteroid impacts.",
    "Explanations": [
      "A is incorrect. Because the moon's surface is not smooth but covered in craters and rough terrain, contradicting the idea of uniform smoothness.",
      "B is correct. Because the moon's surface features large craters caused by asteroid impacts, aligning with the concept of its varied geological features.",
      "C is incorrect. Because the moon is made of rock, not cheese, contrasting with scientific evidence of its geological composition.",
      "D is incorrect. Because the moon lacks lakes or liquid water, diverging from the key concept by misrepresenting its surface conditions."

    "Q": "As a car approaches you in the night",
    "Options": "A. the headlights become more intense, B. the headlights recede into the dark, C. the headlights remain at a constant, D. the headlights turn off",
    "Key Information": "The intensity of headlights appears to increase as a car approaches due to the reduction in distance, allowing more light to reach the observer.",
    "Explanations": [
      "A is correct. Because the intensity of headlights increases as the distance decreases, consistent with the concept of light appearing more intense as a car approaches.",
      "B is incorrect. Because headlights become more visible, not less, as a car approaches, contradicting the concept of increasing intensity with proximity.",
      "C is incorrect. Because the apparent brightness of headlights increases as the car comes closer, not remaining constant, diverging from the notion of constant intensity.",
      "D is incorrect. Because headlights typically do not turn off as a car approaches, unrelated to the concept of light behavior with respect to distance."

    "Q": "When the weather changes as it does from Christmas to Easter,",
    "Options": "A. the air may chill, B. the ground may freeze, C. the plants may die, D. the ground may warm",
    "Key Information": "The period from Christmas to Easter typically involves a transition from winter to spring in many parts of the world, marked by gradually increasing temperatures and thawing conditions.",
    "Explanations": [
      "A is incorrect. Because the trend from Christmas to Easter is toward warmer weather, not colder, contrasting with the concept of seasonal warming.",
      "B is incorrect. Because ground freezing aligns more with winter's onset; the period to Easter typically sees thawing, opposing the warming trend concept.",
      "C is incorrect. Because the approach to Easter, signaling spring, is a time for plant life to begin thriving again, not dying, contradicting the concept of seasonal renewal.",
      "D is correct. Because the ground warming from Christmas to Easter reflects the transition from winter to spring, consistent with the concept of increasing temperatures."

    "Q": "Heat and moisture in the ocean is a good recipe for",

    "Key Information": "Heat and moisture in the ocean contribute to the formation of storms by providing the energy and water vapor necessary for their development.",
    "Explanations": [
      "A is correct. Because heat and moisture are key ingredients for storm development over the ocean, directly aligning with the concept of storm formation.",
      "B is incorrect. Because the link between heat and moisture and 'violent sea animals' is not relevant to the meteorological focus of the key concept.",
      "C is incorrect. Because while condensation is a component of storm formation, it does not fully encompass the broader process of storm development indicated by the key concept.",
      "D is incorrect. Because heat and moisture contribute to storms that can affect inland areas, demonstrating the widespread impact of these conditions beyond the immediate ocean environment."

    "Q": "Hummingbirds take what with them",
    "Options": "A. Bees, B. energy, C. Pollen, D. Honey",
    "Key Information": "As pollinators, hummingbirds interact with flowers for nectar, during which they inadvertently collect and transfer pollen.",
    "Explanations": [
      "A is incorrect. Because hummingbirds do not transport bees, unrelated to their role as pollinators.",
      "B is incorrect. Because while hummingbirds expend energy, saying they 'take energy' is too abstract and unrelated to their pollination activities.",
      "C is correct. Because pollen is transferred by hummingbirds as they feed on nectar, aligning with their role as pollinators.",
      "D is incorrect. Because hummingbirds consume nectar, not honey, which is unrelated to their interaction with flowers."

    "Q": "What covers over 90% of the Earth's surface and 0% of the moon's surface",
    "Options": "A. a magnesium iron silicate mineral, B. chemical element with the symbol S, C. the element with the symbol Fe, D. that which contains 2 hydrogen and 1 oxygen molecules",
    "Key Information": "A substance that is abundant on Earth's surface but nonexistent on the moon's surface, pointing towards Earth's unique characteristic related to its surface coverage.",
    "Explanations": [
      "A is incorrect. Because magnesium iron silicate minerals are primarily found in Earth's mantle, not its surface, and have no relevance to the moon's surface.",
      "B is incorrect. Because Sulfur does not cover Earth's surface, making it irrelevant to the comparison with the moon.",
      "C is incorrect. Because iron (Fe) is common in both Earth's and the moon's compositions but does not cover Earth's surface in the context required by the question.",
      "D is correct. Because water, composed of 2 hydrogen and 1 oxygen molecules (H2O), covers over 70% of Earth's surface but 0% of the moon's surface, aligning with Earth's unique surface characteristics. "
