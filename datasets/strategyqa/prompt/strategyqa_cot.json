    "Explanations": [
      "A is incorrect. Because hydrogen's atomic number squared (1) does not exceed the Spice Girls' member count (5).",
      "B is correct. Because since hydrogen's atomic number squared equals 1, it is less than the Spice Girls' 5 members, aligning with the key concept."

    "Key Information": "The natural gestation period of a llama is approximately 11 months, and the specific duration of the War in Vietnam stated to be 6 months.",
    "Explanations": [
      "A is incorrect. Because the llama's 11-month gestation period surpasses the 6-month Vietnam War duration, making two births impossible within this timeframe.",
      "B is correct. Because given the llama's gestation period and the war's duration, it's biologically impossible for a llama to give birth twice during the conflict."

      "A is incorrect. Because pears float due to a density less than water, attributed to their fibrous and airy composition.",
      "B is correct. Because pears float in water because of their air-filled fibrous structure, making them less dense than water."
